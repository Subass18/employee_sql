# SQL Query Practice Project

## 📌 Overview

This project contains a collection of SQL queries to practice and master different SQL concepts. The queries are written and tested using **MySQL Workbench**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Development Tool:** MySQL Workbench  

## 📂 Project Structure

The project consists of multiple SQL files, each covering a different topic:

📌 **Table Creation & Data**  
- `CREATE_TABLE.sql` → Contains table creation scripts and sample data.  

📌 **SQL Queries**  
- `subquery.sql` → Demonstrates subqueries ,correlated subqueries & Shows nested subqueries.  
- `joins.sql` → Covers INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN,SELF JOIN,NATURAL JOIN,CROSS JOIN 
- `clauses.sql` → Implements GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses.  
- `single & multiRow functions.sql` → Demonstrates single-row and multi-row functions.  
- `operator_functions.sql` → Covers different SQL operators.
- 'Insert_data' → using for inserting data in the Table

## 🗄 Database Schema  

The database consists of four tables:  

1. **Employee** - Contains **50 records** of employees.  
2. **Department** - Stores **5 records** of departments.  
3. **Project** - Holds **10 records** of projects.  
4. **Employee_Project** - Tracks **32 records** linking employees to projects.  

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open **MySQL Workbench** and connect to your database.  
2. Run `CREATE_TABLE.sql` to set up the database schema and insert sample data.  
3. Execute individual SQL files to practice specific topics.  
4. Modify and experiment with queries to enhance your SQL skills.
